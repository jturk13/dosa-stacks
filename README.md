I was tasked to make a ***Queue*** class. It should include methods for enqueuing, dequeuing, peeking, and checking if the queue is empty.

Make it throw an error if you try to dequeue from an empty queue.

also isnt tasked to make a ***Stack*** class. It should include methods for pushing, popping, peeking, and checking if the stack is empty.

Make it throw an error if you try to pop from an empty stack.
